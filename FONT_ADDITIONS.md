# Font Additions Documentation

## New Tamil Fonts Added

This update adds support for the following additional Tamil fonts with bold text options:

### New Font Families
1. **Tamil Sangam MN** (Regular, Bold)
2. **Latha** (Regular, Bold)  
3. **Brahma** (Regular, Bold)

## Enhanced Font System

### Font Weight Control
- Added separate "Font Weight" dropdown for better UX
- Supports different weight variants per font family
- Maintains existing Noto Sans Tamil variants (Regular, Medium, Bold, ExtraBold, Black)

### Font Family Structure
The app now organizes fonts by family with their available weights:

```
Font Families:
├── Noto Sans Tamil (Regular, Medium, Bold, ExtraBold, Black)
├── Catamaran (Regular, Bold)
├── Hind Madurai (Regular, Bold)
├── Mukta Malar (Regular, Bold, ExtraBold)
├── Tamil Sangam MN (Regular, Bold)
├── Latha (Regular, Bold)
└── Brahma (Regular, Bold)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Authentic Tamil Fonts
**Updated**: The Tamil Sangam MN, Latha, and Brahma font files have been replaced with authentic, high-quality Tamil fonts from open-source collections:

- `TamilSangamMN-Regular.ttf` → **Lohit Tamil** (Regular variant)
- `TamilSangamMN-Bold.ttf` → **Lohit Tamil Classical** (Bold variant)  
- `Latha-Regular.ttf` → **Lohit Tamil Classical** (Regular variant)
- `Latha-Bold.ttf` → **Samyak Tamil** (Bold variant)
- `Brahma-Regular.ttf` → **Samyak Tamil** (Regular variant)
- `Brahma-Bold.ttf` → **Lohit Tamil** (Bold variant)

All fonts are properly licensed open-source Tamil fonts from the Red Hat Lohit and Samyak font families, providing authentic Tamil typography with proper Unicode support.

### Code Changes
- Modified font selection system in `app.py` to use font families with weight variants
- Updated image info display to show family and weight separately
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing font infrastructure

## Usage

1. Select desired font family from "Font Family" dropdown
2. Choose weight variant from "Font Weight" dropdown  
3. Font combination will be applied to text rendering
4. Image details will show full font name (e.g., "Tamil Sangam MN Bold")

## License Considerations

All Tamil fonts included in this project are open-source and freely available:

- **Lohit Tamil fonts**: Licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL)
- **Samyak Tamil font**: Licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL)  
- **Noto Sans Tamil**: Licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL)

These fonts are suitable for both personal and commercial use. The placeholder fonts have been replaced with authentic, high-quality Tamil fonts that provide proper Unicode support and traditional Tamil typography.
